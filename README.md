## Time resolving capability of the human eye
As excitation of the light-perceptive cells of the retina always takes a little longer than the light stimulus, only a limited number
of stimuli per unit of time can be processed (time-related resolving power of the eye). If a light source is switched on and off
periodically in increasingly rapid sequence the eye at first perceives the individual flashes, then the appearance of flicker occurs
and finally the impression of a continuous light (fusion of the flicker). The frequency of stimulation at which the latter occurs, the
flicker fusion frequency, is related to the intensity, wave length and also the direction of incidence of the light. By adapting to
the surrounding light intensity, the eye can change the intensity of light entering through the open (darkened room) or nearly
closed (heavily lit room) iris.

## Principle
The flicker fusion frequency, the frequency at which the impression of a continuous light source just occurs, is measured to study
the time resolving capacity of the human eye. A perimeter is used to study the relation between the lightâ€™s incidence angle and
the flicker fusion frequency.
